# Amazon A+ Content Modules · A+ 页面模块图

Builds a complete, visually consistent A+ page: module plan → style lock → one prompt per module → exact pixel sizes.

> Part of [ecommerce-image-skills](https://github.com/xianyu110/ecommerce-image-skills). Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`. Default model: GPT Image 2.5 **Flare**.

## Step 1 · Product identity lock (always first)

Before writing any prompt, study every reference photo and write a short **identity lock** for the product. Paste it verbatim into **every** prompt this skill produces, and never let a creative instruction override it.

```text
PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK (do not change):
- Shape & proportions: <e.g. tall cylinder, rounded shoulders, 26 cm high, 7.5 cm wide>
- Colour & finish: <e.g. matte sage green #8FA58C body, natural bamboo lid>
- Logo & printed text: <exact spelling, font feel, position, colour — e.g. white "AURA" wordmark centred on upper body>
- Parts & details: <lid, loop, buttons, ports, seams, labels, accessories that are included>
- Must NOT appear: <accessories not in the box, extra logos, invented claims>
```

Rules:
- Only use facts visible in the photos or confirmed by the user. If something is unknown (size, capacity, material), ask or leave it out — never invent specs or certifications.
- If the user gave no photo, ask for one (front view at minimum). Text-only generation is allowed but say the result is a concept, not the real product.

## Step 2 · Pick the model

| Use **Flare** (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, default) | Switch to **Sunburst** (`gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`) |
|---|---|
| New scenes, backgrounds, layouts, many quick variations | The product's logo / label / small text must survive exactly |
| Text-to-image concepts | Local edits: swap background, recolour, remove objects, keep everything else |
| Drafts for the user to pick from | Final hero assets and anything with dense typography |

If an endpoint only exposes other image models, use the closest equivalent and tell the user.

## A+ module sizes (Basic A+)

| Module | Image size (px) |
|---|---|
| Standard image header with text | **970 × 600** |
| Standard company logo | 600 × 180 |
| Standard image & dark/light text overlay | 970 × 300 |
| Standard single image & sidebar | 300 × 400 (main) / 350 × 175 (sidebar) |
| Standard four image & text | 220 × 220 ×4 |
| Standard three images & text | 300 × 300 ×3 |
| Standard comparison chart | 150 × 300 per product |
| Standard single left/right image | 300 × 300 |
| Brand story background | 1464 × 625 |
| Premium A+ full image | 1464 × 600 (desktop) / 600 × 450 (mobile) |

Max file size 2 MB per image; JPG/PNG; no prices, promos, shipping claims, or competitor references; text in images should also appear in alt text.

## Step A · Module plan (confirm with user)
Default 5-module story: ① 970×600 header (brand promise) → ② 3×300×300 key benefits → ③ 970×300 lifestyle banner → ④ 4×220×220 details → ⑤ comparison chart (own range only).

## Step B · Campaign style lock (paste into every module prompt)
```text
CAMPAIGN STYLE LOCK: palette {hex1, hex2, hex3}; light {soft daylight from left}; background family {warm stone + linen};
type {geometric sans, bold headlines, sentence case}; mood {calm premium outdoor}; camera {50mm, eye level}.
```

## Step C · Module prompt template
```text
Amazon A+ module image, {module name}, final size {W}×{H} px (generate at {closest supported ratio}, then crop).
{IDENTITY_LOCK}
{CAMPAIGN STYLE LOCK}
Content: {what this module must communicate, e.g. 'brand promise: keeps drinks cold for 24h on any adventure'}.
Composition: product {left third | centre}, {scene}, leave {right 40% | top band} clean for the headline.
{Headline (exact): "..." — or: no text, copy will be added in Seller Central.}
Photorealistic, consistent with the campaign style lock.
```

Generate at 1536×1024 (≈ 970×600) or 1024×1024 for square tiles, then resize/crop exactly:

```bash
python scripts/crop_to_modules.py out/header.png --module header   # → 970x600
python scripts/crop_to_modules.py out/tile.png --module tile300      # → 300x300
```

## Generate · three routes (pick the first that works)

**(a) Built-in image tool.** If your agent already has an image generation/editing tool (e.g. Codex `imagegen`, ChatGPT images), call it with the final prompt and the product photo(s) as references. Done.

**(b) API key.** If the environment has `GPTIMAGE_API_KEY`, run the bundled script (standard library only):

```bash
# optional: any OpenAI-compatible gateway; defaults to https://api.openai.com
export GPTIMAGE_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example.com"
python scripts/generate.py --model flare --image product.jpg --size 1536x1024 \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --out out/amazon-a-plus.png
```

`--image` can be repeated (product front/side/logo close-up). Without `--image` it does text-to-image.

**(c) No tool, no key.** Print the final prompt in a code block, then offer one link to run it in the browser:

```bash
python scripts/online_link.py --skill amazon-a-plus "<final prompt>"
# → https://gptimage2.asia/generate?prompt=<urlencoded>&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=ecommerce-image-skills&utm_content=amazon-a-plus
```

Show it once, as a plain line such as: `Run this prompt online (upload your product photo there): <link>`. Don't repeat it in later turns unless asked.

## Deliver

1. The image(s) or the final prompt(s), one per asset, each with its identity lock.
2. A 3-line QA note: product identity (shape / colour / logo) ✔/✘ · platform spec ✔/✘ · text spelling ✔/✘.
3. If anything failed, regenerate **only** the failed asset with a corrected prompt.
