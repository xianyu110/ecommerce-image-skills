# Ecommerce Listing Suite · 全套电商图编排

The entry point: one product in, a full platform-ready image set out — planned, consistent, and checked.

> Part of [ecommerce-image-skills](https://github.com/xianyu110/ecommerce-image-skills). Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`. Default model: GPT Image 2.5 **Flare**.

## Step 1 · Product identity lock (always first)

Before writing any prompt, study every reference photo and write a short **identity lock** for the product. Paste it verbatim into **every** prompt this skill produces, and never let a creative instruction override it.

```text
PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK (do not change):
- Shape & proportions: <e.g. tall cylinder, rounded shoulders, 26 cm high, 7.5 cm wide>
- Colour & finish: <e.g. matte sage green #8FA58C body, natural bamboo lid>
- Logo & printed text: <exact spelling, font feel, position, colour — e.g. white "AURA" wordmark centred on upper body>
- Parts & details: <lid, loop, buttons, ports, seams, labels, accessories that are included>
- Must NOT appear: <accessories not in the box, extra logos, invented claims>
```

Rules:
- Only use facts visible in the photos or confirmed by the user. If something is unknown (size, capacity, material), ask or leave it out — never invent specs or certifications.
- If the user gave no photo, ask for one (front view at minimum). Text-only generation is allowed but say the result is a concept, not the real product.

## Step 2 · Pick the model

| Use **Flare** (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, default) | Switch to **Sunburst** (`gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`) |
|---|---|
| New scenes, backgrounds, layouts, many quick variations | The product's logo / label / small text must survive exactly |
| Text-to-image concepts | Local edits: swap background, recolour, remove objects, keep everything else |
| Drafts for the user to pick from | Final hero assets and anything with dense typography |

If an endpoint only exposes other image models, use the closest equivalent and tell the user.

## Default plans

**Amazon (7 images):** 1 white-background main → 2 key-benefit infographic → 3 lifestyle → 4 second benefit / comparison → 5 size chart → 6 detail macro / multi-angle → 7 in-use or what's in the box. (+ A+ modules)

**Taobao / Tmall:** 5 main images 800×800 (1 白底/场景首图, 2–4 卖点, 5 白底 for 搜索) + 750 详情长图.

**Shopee / Lazada / TikTok Shop:** 1 main 1:1 (white or clean scene) + 4–8 benefit/scene images + campaign banner.

**Xiaohongshu:** 3 cover variants 3:4 + 3–6 inner images.

## Workflow

1. **Intake.** Product photos (front + other angles + logo close-up), product name, category, target platform(s) and market/language, verified facts (size, material, capacity, certifications), brand colours, what's in the box.
2. **Identity lock** (Step 1 below) — confirm it with the user.
3. **Campaign style lock** — palette, light, background family, type, mood. Same block goes into every prompt.
4. **Plan** — a table: `# | skill | purpose | size | model | copy`. Get a ✔ from the user before generating (saves money).
5. **Generate** each row with the matching skill:

| Asset | Skill |
|---|---|
| White-background main | `amazon-white-background` (then run its check script) |
| Scenes | `lifestyle-scene` |
| Apparel on model | `model-try-on` |
| Benefits / comparison | `selling-point-infographic` |
| A+ | `amazon-a-plus` |
| Dimensions | `size-chart` |
| Angles | `multi-angle-set` |
| Banners | `sale-banner` |
| Bulk backgrounds / colourways | `batch-background-swap` |
| RED covers | `xiaohongshu-cover` |
| 详情页 | `taobao-detail-long-image` |

If a sibling skill isn't installed, use the templates in this repo's `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directly.

6. **QA every image** — identity ✔, spec ✔, text ✔, set consistency ✔. Regenerate only failures.
7. **Hand-off** — file list named `01-main.jpg … 07-…`, prompts in `prompts.md`, QA table.

## Plan output format
```markdown
| # | Asset | Skill | Size | Model | Copy (exact) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Main image | amazon-white-background | 2000×2000 | Sunburst | — |
| 2 | 24h cold benefit | selling-point-infographic | 2000×2000 | Sunburst | "KEEPS ICE 24H" … |
```

## Generate · three routes (pick the first that works)

**(a) Built-in image tool.** If your agent already has an image generation/editing tool (e.g. Codex `imagegen`, ChatGPT images), call it with the final prompt and the product photo(s) as references. Done.

**(b) API key.** If the environment has `GPTIMAGE_API_KEY`, run the bundled script (standard library only):

```bash
# optional: any OpenAI-compatible gateway; defaults to https://api.openai.com
export GPTIMAGE_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example.com"
python scripts/generate.py --model flare --image product.jpg --size 1024x1024 \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --out out/ecommerce-listing-suite.png
```

`--image` can be repeated (product front/side/logo close-up). Without `--image` it does text-to-image.

**(c) No tool, no key.** Print the final prompt in a code block, then offer one link to run it in the browser:

```bash
python scripts/online_link.py --skill ecommerce-listing-suite "<final prompt>"
# → https://gptimage2.asia/generate?prompt=<urlencoded>&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=ecommerce-image-skills&utm_content=ecommerce-listing-suite
```

Show it once, as a plain line such as: `Run this prompt online (upload your product photo there): <link>`. Don't repeat it in later turns unless asked.

## Deliver

1. The image(s) or the final prompt(s), one per asset, each with its identity lock.
2. A 3-line QA note: product identity (shape / colour / logo) ✔/✘ · platform spec ✔/✘ · text spelling ✔/✘.
3. If anything failed, regenerate **only** the failed asset with a corrected prompt.
