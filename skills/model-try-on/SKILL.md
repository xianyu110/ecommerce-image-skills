# Model Try-On · 模特上身图

From a flat-lay or hanger shot to catalogue-quality on-model photos — without a studio or a model booking.

> Part of [ecommerce-image-skills](https://github.com/xianyu110/ecommerce-image-skills). Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`. Default model: GPT Image 2.5 **Sunburst**.

## Step 1 · Product identity lock (always first)

Before writing any prompt, study every reference photo and write a short **identity lock** for the garment. Paste it verbatim into **every** prompt this skill produces, and never let a creative instruction override it.

```text
PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK (do not change):
- Shape & proportions: <e.g. tall cylinder, rounded shoulders, 26 cm high, 7.5 cm wide>
- Colour & finish: <e.g. matte sage green #8FA58C body, natural bamboo lid>
- Logo & printed text: <exact spelling, font feel, position, colour — e.g. white "AURA" wordmark centred on upper body>
- Parts & details: <lid, loop, buttons, ports, seams, labels, accessories that are included>
- Must NOT appear: <accessories not in the box, extra logos, invented claims>
```

Rules:
- Only use facts visible in the photos or confirmed by the user. If something is unknown (size, capacity, material), ask or leave it out — never invent specs or certifications.
- If the user gave no photo, ask for one (front view at minimum). Text-only generation is allowed but say the result is a concept, not the real product.

## Step 2 · Pick the model

| Use **Flare** (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, default) | Switch to **Sunburst** (`gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`) |
|---|---|
| New scenes, backgrounds, layouts, many quick variations | The product's logo / label / small text must survive exactly |
| Text-to-image concepts | Local edits: swap background, recolour, remove objects, keep everything else |
| Drafts for the user to pick from | Final hero assets and anything with dense typography |

If an endpoint only exposes other image models, use the closest equivalent and tell the user.

## Specs & ethics

| Platform | Ratio | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon fashion | 1:1 or 5:6 (e.g. 1500×1800) | Main image: product on model or flat; light grey/white backdrop |
| Taobao / Tmall | 3:4 (750×1000) | |
| Shopee / TikTok Shop | 1:1 or 3:4 | |
| Lookbook / social | 4:5, 9:16 | |

- Use synthetic models only (no real person's likeness unless the user owns the rights). Don't sexualise; keep body proportions natural.
- Offer at least two body types / sizes when the user sells a size range.

## Inputs
1. Garment photo(s): flat-lay or hanger, front (+ back / detail if available).
2. Optional pose / scene reference image.
3. Model brief: gender, age range, region, body type, hair, styling (bottoms, shoes).

## Prompt template

```text
On-model ecommerce photo.
GARMENT IDENTITY LOCK: {identity lock — colour, fabric texture, cut/fit, neckline, sleeve, hem, prints, logo text and position, trims}.
Keep the garment 100% faithful; do not change colour, pattern, logo or length.
Model: {a natural-looking {region} {gender} in their {age}s, {body type}, {hair}}, wearing the garment with {styling}.
Pose: {relaxed standing, one hand in pocket | walking | seated}, {full body | three-quarter | waist-up}, {front | 3/4 | back} view.
{If pose reference: Copy pose, framing and lighting from image 2; take the garment only from image 1.}
Background: {plain light-grey studio | white | urban street | cafe}. Soft key light, realistic fabric folds and drape.
Catalogue photography, photorealistic. No text, no watermark.
```

Variants: `ghost mannequin` (invisible body, hollow neckline), `jewellery close-up` (ear/neck/hand crop, macro lens, skin texture natural), `size comparison` (same outfit on S and XL models side by side).

## Generate · three routes (pick the first that works)

**(a) Built-in image tool.** If your agent already has an image generation/editing tool (e.g. Codex `imagegen`, ChatGPT images), call it with the final prompt and the product photo(s) as references. Done.

**(b) API key.** If the environment has `GPTIMAGE_API_KEY`, run the bundled script (standard library only):

```bash
# optional: any OpenAI-compatible gateway; defaults to https://api.openai.com
export GPTIMAGE_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example.com"
python scripts/generate.py --model sunburst --image product.jpg --size 1024x1536 \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --out out/model-try-on.png
```

`--image` can be repeated (product front/side/logo close-up). Without `--image` it does text-to-image.

**(c) No tool, no key.** Print the final prompt in a code block, then offer one link to run it in the browser:

```bash
python scripts/online_link.py --skill model-try-on "<final prompt>"
# → https://gptimage2.asia/generate?prompt=<urlencoded>&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=ecommerce-image-skills&utm_content=model-try-on
```

Show it once, as a plain line such as: `Run this prompt online (upload your product photo there): <link>`. Don't repeat it in later turns unless asked.

## Deliver

1. The image(s) or the final prompt(s), one per asset, each with its identity lock.
2. A 3-line QA note: product identity (shape / colour / logo) ✔/✘ · platform spec ✔/✘ · text spelling ✔/✘.
3. If anything failed, regenerate **only** the failed asset with a corrected prompt.
