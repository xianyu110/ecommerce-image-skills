name: multi-angle-set
description: "Generate a consistent multi-angle product image set (front, back, left/right side, top, 45°, detail macro, packaging, in-hand) with identical lighting and background, optionally combined into a grid. Use for 多角度图, 多视角套图, 360 view, angle set, gallery images."

# Multi-Angle Set · 多角度套图

One product, 6–9 matching angles — same light, same background, same colour — so the gallery looks shot in one session.

> Part of [ecommerce-image-skills](https://github.com/xianyu110/ecommerce-image-skills). Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`. Default model: GPT Image 2.5 **Sunburst**.

## Step 1 · Product identity lock (always first)

Before writing any prompt, study every reference photo and write a short **identity lock** for the product. Paste it verbatim into **every** prompt this skill produces, and never let a creative instruction override it.

```text
PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK (do not change):
- Shape & proportions: <e.g. tall cylinder, rounded shoulders, 26 cm high, 7.5 cm wide>
- Colour & finish: <e.g. matte sage green #8FA58C body, natural bamboo lid>
- Logo & printed text: <exact spelling, font feel, position, colour — e.g. white "AURA" wordmark centred on upper body>
- Parts & details: <lid, loop, buttons, ports, seams, labels, accessories that are included>
- Must NOT appear: <accessories not in the box, extra logos, invented claims>
```

Rules:
- Only use facts visible in the photos or confirmed by the user. If something is unknown (size, capacity, material), ask or leave it out — never invent specs or certifications.
- If the user gave no photo, ask for one (front view at minimum). Text-only generation is allowed but say the result is a concept, not the real product.

## Step 2 · Pick the model

| Use **Flare** (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, default) | Switch to **Sunburst** (`gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`) |
|---|---|
| New scenes, backgrounds, layouts, many quick variations | The product's logo / label / small text must survive exactly |
| Text-to-image concepts | Local edits: swap background, recolour, remove objects, keep everything else |
| Drafts for the user to pick from | Final hero assets and anything with dense typography |

If an endpoint only exposes other image models, use the closest equivalent and tell the user.

## Specs
- Amazon gallery: up to 9 images (7 visible on desktop), 1:1.
- Taobao/Tmall: 5 main images 800×800, plus detail screens.
- Shopify: 1:1 or 4:5; keep the same ratio for the whole set.
- Give the model **every real angle you have** (front, back, side, logo close-up) — it can't know what the back looks like.

## Shot list (default 6)
1. Front, straight on · 2. 45° front-left · 3. Side profile · 4. Back · 5. Top-down · 6. Detail macro of {lid/texture/port/logo}
Optional: 7. Packaging + product · 8. In hand for scale · 9. Exploded / parts laid out.

## Set lock (prepend to every shot)
```text
SET LOCK: background {seamless light warm-grey #EDEBE8 | white #FFFFFF}; lighting {large softbox front-left 45°, white fill right, soft floor shadow};
camera {85mm, f/8, product centred, fills 80% of frame}; colour grading neutral.
```

## Prompt template (one per angle)
```text
Ecommerce product photo, angle {N}/{total}: {angle description}.
{IDENTITY_LOCK}
{SET LOCK}
Show only what is physically on this side of the product; do not move logos or text to faces where they don't exist.
Photorealistic studio photography, sharp detail, no added text. Square 1:1.
```

## Grid (optional)
```bash
pip install pillow
python scripts/make_grid.py out/angle-*.png --cols 3 --out out/multi-angle-grid.png
```

## Generate · three routes (pick the first that works)

**(a) Built-in image tool.** If your agent already has an image generation/editing tool (e.g. Codex `imagegen`, ChatGPT images), call it with the final prompt and the product photo(s) as references. Done.

**(b) API key.** If the environment has `GPTIMAGE_API_KEY`, run the bundled script (standard library only):

```bash
# optional: any OpenAI-compatible gateway; defaults to https://api.openai.com
export GPTIMAGE_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example.com"
python scripts/generate.py --model sunburst --image product.jpg --size 1024x1024 \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --out out/multi-angle-set.png
```

`--image` can be repeated (product front/side/logo close-up). Without `--image` it does text-to-image.

**(c) No tool, no key.** Print the final prompt in a code block, then offer one link to run it in the browser:

```bash
python scripts/online_link.py --skill multi-angle-set "<final prompt>"
# → https://gptimage2.asia/generate?prompt=<urlencoded>&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=ecommerce-image-skills&utm_content=multi-angle-set
```

Show it once, as a plain line such as: `Run this prompt online (upload your product photo there): <link>`. Don't repeat it in later turns unless asked.

## Deliver

1. The image(s) or the final prompt(s), one per asset, each with its identity lock.
2. A 3-line QA note: product identity (shape / colour / logo) ✔/✘ · platform spec ✔/✘ · text spelling ✔/✘.
3. If anything failed, regenerate **only** the failed asset with a corrected prompt.
