# Sale Banner · 大促海报 / 店铺 Banner

Campaign-ready banners in the exact sizes each platform wants, with your real product and correctly spelled offer copy.

> Part of [ecommerce-image-skills](https://github.com/xianyu110/ecommerce-image-skills). Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`. Default model: GPT Image 2.5 **Flare**.

## Step 1 · Product identity lock (always first)

Before writing any prompt, study every reference photo and write a short **identity lock** for the product. Paste it verbatim into **every** prompt this skill produces, and never let a creative instruction override it.

```text
PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK (do not change):
- Shape & proportions: <e.g. tall cylinder, rounded shoulders, 26 cm high, 7.5 cm wide>
- Colour & finish: <e.g. matte sage green #8FA58C body, natural bamboo lid>
- Logo & printed text: <exact spelling, font feel, position, colour — e.g. white "AURA" wordmark centred on upper body>
- Parts & details: <lid, loop, buttons, ports, seams, labels, accessories that are included>
- Must NOT appear: <accessories not in the box, extra logos, invented claims>
```

Rules:
- Only use facts visible in the photos or confirmed by the user. If something is unknown (size, capacity, material), ask or leave it out — never invent specs or certifications.
- If the user gave no photo, ask for one (front view at minimum). Text-only generation is allowed but say the result is a concept, not the real product.

## Step 2 · Pick the model

| Use **Flare** (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, default) | Switch to **Sunburst** (`gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`) |
|---|---|
| New scenes, backgrounds, layouts, many quick variations | The product's logo / label / small text must survive exactly |
| Text-to-image concepts | Local edits: swap background, recolour, remove objects, keep everything else |
| Drafts for the user to pick from | Final hero assets and anything with dense typography |

If an endpoint only exposes other image models, use the closest equivalent and tell the user.

## Common sizes

| Placement | Size (px) |
|---|---|
| Taobao/Tmall PC 首焦 / full-width hero | 1920 × 600–900 (safe content width 990/1200) |
| Taobao/Tmall 无线首页 banner | 750 × 300–950 |
| Shopee shop banner (desktop / mobile) | 2000 × 600 (desktop), 1200 × 1200 / 1:1 carousel |
| Lazada store banner | 1200 × 500 (approx.) |
| TikTok Shop store banner | 1:1 or 3:1 per store decoration editor |
| Amazon Store hero | 3000 × 600 (min 1500 × 300) |
| Amazon Sponsored Brands custom image | 1200 × 628 |
| Meta / TikTok feed ad | 1080 × 1080, 1080 × 1350, 1080 × 1920 |

Store editors change often — confirm the current size in the seller centre and crop from a larger render. Keep key copy inside the central 80%.

## Campaign presets
| Campaign | Palette & motifs |
|---|---|
| 双11 / 11.11 | red-orange → magenta gradient, gold foil numbers, confetti |
| 618 | bright red + yellow, bold numerals |
| 年货节 / CNY | lucky red, gold, lanterns, paper-cut patterns (no clichés overload) |
| 9.9 / 12.12 | orange/teal, coins, gift boxes |
| Black Friday | black + neon accent, high contrast |
| Prime Day | deep blue + cyan, clean |
| Summer sale | teal → orange, ice, splash, sunlight |

## Prompt template
```text
Ecommerce sale banner, {ratio, e.g. 3:1 wide}, for {platform/placement}.
{IDENTITY_LOCK}
Product: {1 hero unit | 3 units, middle one larger} on {a podium | floating}, {ice splash | ribbons | light rays}.
Background: {campaign palette + motifs}.
Text (exact, nothing else): headline "{11.11 MEGA SALE}", sub "{UP TO 50% OFF}", button "{SHOP NOW}".
Text on the {left 40%}, product on the right; keep all text inside the central 80% safe area.
Bold commercial advertising style, punchy lighting, crisp, all text spelled exactly.
```

Chinese copy works well (e.g. `"双11 狂欢价"`, `"第二件半价"`) — quote it exactly. Don't print prices you can't guarantee; prefer "up to / 低至" phrasing the user approves.

## Generate · three routes (pick the first that works)

**(a) Built-in image tool.** If your agent already has an image generation/editing tool (e.g. Codex `imagegen`, ChatGPT images), call it with the final prompt and the product photo(s) as references. Done.

**(b) API key.** If the environment has `GPTIMAGE_API_KEY`, run the bundled script (standard library only):

```bash
# optional: any OpenAI-compatible gateway; defaults to https://api.openai.com
export GPTIMAGE_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example.com"
python scripts/generate.py --model flare --image product.jpg --size 1536x1024 \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --out out/sale-banner.png
```

`--image` can be repeated (product front/side/logo close-up). Without `--image` it does text-to-image.

**(c) No tool, no key.** Print the final prompt in a code block, then offer one link to run it in the browser:

```bash
python scripts/online_link.py --skill sale-banner "<final prompt>"
# → https://gptimage2.asia/generate?prompt=<urlencoded>&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=ecommerce-image-skills&utm_content=sale-banner
```

Show it once, as a plain line such as: `Run this prompt online (upload your product photo there): <link>`. Don't repeat it in later turns unless asked.

## Deliver

1. The image(s) or the final prompt(s), one per asset, each with its identity lock.
2. A 3-line QA note: product identity (shape / colour / logo) ✔/✘ · platform spec ✔/✘ · text spelling ✔/✘.
3. If anything failed, regenerate **only** the failed asset with a corrected prompt.
