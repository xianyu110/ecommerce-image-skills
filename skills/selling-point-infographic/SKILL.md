# Selling-Point Infographic · 卖点信息图

Turns verified product facts into scroll-stopping feature graphics that are readable on a phone.

> Part of [ecommerce-image-skills](https://github.com/xianyu110/ecommerce-image-skills). Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`. Default model: GPT Image 2.5 **Sunburst**.

## Step 1 · Product identity lock (always first)

Before writing any prompt, study every reference photo and write a short **identity lock** for the product. Paste it verbatim into **every** prompt this skill produces, and never let a creative instruction override it.

```text
PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK (do not change):
- Shape & proportions: <e.g. tall cylinder, rounded shoulders, 26 cm high, 7.5 cm wide>
- Colour & finish: <e.g. matte sage green #8FA58C body, natural bamboo lid>
- Logo & printed text: <exact spelling, font feel, position, colour — e.g. white "AURA" wordmark centred on upper body>
- Parts & details: <lid, loop, buttons, ports, seams, labels, accessories that are included>
- Must NOT appear: <accessories not in the box, extra logos, invented claims>
```

Rules:
- Only use facts visible in the photos or confirmed by the user. If something is unknown (size, capacity, material), ask or leave it out — never invent specs or certifications.
- If the user gave no photo, ask for one (front view at minimum). Text-only generation is allowed but say the result is a concept, not the real product.

## Step 2 · Pick the model

| Use **Flare** (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, default) | Switch to **Sunburst** (`gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`) |
|---|---|
| New scenes, backgrounds, layouts, many quick variations | The product's logo / label / small text must survive exactly |
| Text-to-image concepts | Local edits: swap background, recolour, remove objects, keep everything else |
| Drafts for the user to pick from | Final hero assets and anything with dense typography |

If an endpoint only exposes other image models, use the closest equivalent and tell the user.

## Specs

| Platform | Size | Copy rules |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon secondary images (2–7) | 2000×2000 (1:1) | Text allowed; no unverifiable claims ("#1", "best"), no competitor names |
| Taobao/Tmall 主图 2–5 | 800×800 | 卖点 ≤ 3 条，首图避免牛皮癣 |
| Shopee / Lazada | 1:1 | Local language |
| Ads | 4:5 / 1:1 | |

Readability: headline ≥ 7% of image height, body ≥ 3.5%, max ~12 words per image, ≥ 4.5:1 contrast.

## Step 0 · Copy first
Ask the user for (or draft and get approval on) the exact copy: 1 headline + up to 3 feature rows. **Only use claims the user can prove.** Spell-check every word; the model will render exactly what you write.

## Layout menu
- **Hero + 3 rows:** product left 45%, headline + 3 icon rows right.
- **Callouts:** product centred, 3–4 labels with thin lines pointing to parts.
- **Comparison:** left "ours" vs right "ordinary", ✓/✗ rows (no competitor brand).
- **Number hero:** one big number ("24H", "1200 mAh") + product + one-line explanation.

## Prompt template

```text
Ecommerce selling-point infographic, {1:1 | 2:3}.
{IDENTITY_LOCK}
Layout: {layout from menu}. Background: {soft gradient in brand colours {hex1} → {hex2} | clean white | subtle texture}.
Headline (exact): "{HEADLINE}"
Feature rows (exact), each with a thin line icon: "{ROW 1}", "{ROW 2}", "{ROW 3}".
{Callout lines from labels to {parts}.}
Modern sans-serif typography, strong hierarchy, high contrast, generous whitespace, readable on mobile.
Premium minimal brand style. Spell all text exactly as given; no other text.
```

Use **Sunburst** for the final render (text accuracy). If any letter is wrong, regenerate with the misspelt word quoted again, or render without text and add copy in Canva/Figma.

## Generate · three routes (pick the first that works)

**(a) Built-in image tool.** If your agent already has an image generation/editing tool (e.g. Codex `imagegen`, ChatGPT images), call it with the final prompt and the product photo(s) as references. Done.

**(b) API key.** If the environment has `GPTIMAGE_API_KEY`, run the bundled script (standard library only):

```bash
# optional: any OpenAI-compatible gateway; defaults to https://api.openai.com
export GPTIMAGE_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example.com"
python scripts/generate.py --model sunburst --image product.jpg --size 1024x1024 \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --out out/selling-point-infographic.png
```

`--image` can be repeated (product front/side/logo close-up). Without `--image` it does text-to-image.

**(c) No tool, no key.** Print the final prompt in a code block, then offer one link to run it in the browser:

```bash
python scripts/online_link.py --skill selling-point-infographic "<final prompt>"
# → https://gptimage2.asia/generate?prompt=<urlencoded>&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=ecommerce-image-skills&utm_content=selling-point-infographic
```

Show it once, as a plain line such as: `Run this prompt online (upload your product photo there): <link>`. Don't repeat it in later turns unless asked.

## Deliver

1. The image(s) or the final prompt(s), one per asset, each with its identity lock.
2. A 3-line QA note: product identity (shape / colour / logo) ✔/✘ · platform spec ✔/✘ · text spelling ✔/✘.
3. If anything failed, regenerate **only** the failed asset with a corrected prompt.
