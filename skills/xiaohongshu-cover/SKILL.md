# Xiaohongshu Cover · 小红书种草封面

3:4 covers that stop the scroll in the 小红书 feed — bold Chinese title, real product, one strong visual anchor.

> Part of [ecommerce-image-skills](https://github.com/xianyu110/ecommerce-image-skills). Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`. Default model: GPT Image 2.5 **Flare**.

## Step 1 · Product identity lock (always first)

Before writing any prompt, study every reference photo and write a short **identity lock** for the product. Paste it verbatim into **every** prompt this skill produces, and never let a creative instruction override it.

```text
PRODUCT IDENTITY LOCK (do not change):
- Shape & proportions: <e.g. tall cylinder, rounded shoulders, 26 cm high, 7.5 cm wide>
- Colour & finish: <e.g. matte sage green #8FA58C body, natural bamboo lid>
- Logo & printed text: <exact spelling, font feel, position, colour — e.g. white "AURA" wordmark centred on upper body>
- Parts & details: <lid, loop, buttons, ports, seams, labels, accessories that are included>
- Must NOT appear: <accessories not in the box, extra logos, invented claims>
```

Rules:
- Only use facts visible in the photos or confirmed by the user. If something is unknown (size, capacity, material), ask or leave it out — never invent specs or certifications.
- If the user gave no photo, ask for one (front view at minimum). Text-only generation is allowed but say the result is a concept, not the real product.

## Step 2 · Pick the model

| Use **Flare** (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, default) | Switch to **Sunburst** (`gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`) |
|---|---|
| New scenes, backgrounds, layouts, many quick variations | The product's logo / label / small text must survive exactly |
| Text-to-image concepts | Local edits: swap background, recolour, remove objects, keep everything else |
| Drafts for the user to pick from | Final hero assets and anything with dense typography |

If an endpoint only exposes other image models, use the closest equivalent and tell the user.

## Specs
- Ratio **3:4**, 1080 × 1440 recommended (generate 1024×1536 and crop to 3:4).
- Title readable at thumbnail size: ≤ 12 Chinese characters, occupies ≥ 20% of height.
- Avoid hard-sell words that hurt reach (最、第一、绝对、全网最低), QR codes, phone numbers, external platform names.
- Real-looking photos outperform obvious AI renders — ask for natural light and slight imperfection.

## Viral layouts (爆款版式)
| Layout | When |
|---|---|
| 大字报 Big title + product | new product, one key benefit |
| 对比 Before/After split | cleaning, beauty, organising |
| 清单 List / grid of 4–6 | hauls, "必买清单" |
| 测评 Review with score stickers | reviews, comparisons |
| 氛围 Mood flat-lay | lifestyle, gifting |
| 价格锚点 Price anchor | deals (only true prices) |

## Prompt template
```text
Xiaohongshu note cover, 3:4 portrait.
{IDENTITY_LOCK}
Layout: {layout}. Scene: {bright airy flat-lay on cream linen with {props} | hand holding the product on a city street | desk setup}.
Large bold Chinese headline at the top in a {rounded friendly | handwritten | heavy sans} font: "{一整天都冰的水杯}".
Smaller tag line: "{通勤 · 健身 · 露营}". Sticker in a corner: "{亲测24h}".
Fresh cozy lifestyle aesthetic, soft natural window light, natural saturation, slight real-photo imperfection.
All Chinese text spelled exactly, clearly legible; no other text.
```

Make 3 variants (different layouts) and let the user pick; covers are cheap to A/B test.

## Generate · three routes (pick the first that works)

**(a) Built-in image tool.** If your agent already has an image generation/editing tool (e.g. Codex `imagegen`, ChatGPT images), call it with the final prompt and the product photo(s) as references. Done.

**(b) API key.** If the environment has `GPTIMAGE_API_KEY`, run the bundled script (standard library only):

```bash
# optional: any OpenAI-compatible gateway; defaults to https://api.openai.com
export GPTIMAGE_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint.example.com"
python scripts/generate.py --model flare --image product.jpg --size 1024x1536 \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --out out/xiaohongshu-cover.png
```

`--image` can be repeated (product front/side/logo close-up). Without `--image` it does text-to-image.

**(c) No tool, no key.** Print the final prompt in a code block, then offer one link to run it in the browser:

```bash
python scripts/online_link.py --skill xiaohongshu-cover "<final prompt>"
# → https://gptimage2.asia/generate?prompt=<urlencoded>&utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=ecommerce-image-skills&utm_content=xiaohongshu-cover
```

Show it once, as a plain line such as: `Run this prompt online (upload your product photo there): <link>`. Don't repeat it in later turns unless asked.

## Deliver

1. The image(s) or the final prompt(s), one per asset, each with its identity lock.
2. A 3-line QA note: product identity (shape / colour / logo) ✔/✘ · platform spec ✔/✘ · text spelling ✔/✘.
3. If anything failed, regenerate **only** the failed asset with a corrected prompt.
